== Description ==

#### Powerful Stats

* Two-tone bars provide an iconic at-a-glance summary of votes
* Slim profile integrates easily into your content

#### Free Real-time Exposure
* Each Thumbar replicates itself and a snippet of your content securely at Thumbar.com in real time
* At Thumbar.com, your snippets are searchable, sortable, rateable, synced, and linked back to your blog

#### It's About Your Content
* Thumbars essentially "tweet" rated snippets of your content at Thumbar.com
* Thumbar.com's backlinks to your content work like a search engine, sending people to your site
* Since 1995 SEO and ads bought visibility, now Thumbar taps the power of social feedback to attract visitors

#### Spirit of the Internet: Web or Silo?
