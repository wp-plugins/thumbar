Thumbar for WordPress - A free, real-time, socially networked thumb voting plugin for WordPress.



== Description ==
A Thumbar is a voting plugin that is socially networked, so that it can increase a blog's exposure for free. The plugin displays various rating stats and mirrors the ratings with associated content snippets at Thumbar.com, where they are searchable and linked back to their source URLs.


== Installation ==

1. Open thumbar-wp.php in a text editor, change x in uid="x" to your Thumbar.com member id, and save thumbar-wp.php. To get your member id, log into Thumbar.com, click on Tools, and in the code displayed you will see <div class="thumbar" uid="x">, where "x" is your member id.
2. Find your WordPress plugin directory (./wp/wp-content/plugins) and beneath it create a subdirectory named /thumbar.

3. Upload thumbar-wp.php to ./wp/wp-content/plugins/thumbar, so its full path will be ./wp/wp-content/plugins/thumbar/thumbar-wp.php.

4. Log in as administrator into your WordPress Dashboard, click on Plugins to view the Plugins page, find Thumbar, and click on Activate.

5. To register and enable your Thumbar plugin, just rate one of your posts. Create a post if you haven't posted anything yet.

6. Go to a post, click on its Thumbar, and when prompted, log into Thumbar.com, which completes the activation process.
